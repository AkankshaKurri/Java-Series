//Functional Programming: It's a way of writing programs where you use functions like small building blocks.
//Functions as First-Class: Functions can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.
//Immutable Data: Once you create a piece of data, you don't change it.
//Pure Functions: Theses are Special functions that always give the same result for the same input with no Side-Effects.
//Functional Interfaces: These are like templates for functions, making it easier to use them in different parts of your program.
