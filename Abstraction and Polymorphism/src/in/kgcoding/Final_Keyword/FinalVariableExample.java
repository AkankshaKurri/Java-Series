//Final Variable => To create constant variables.

//Variable becomes a constant, meaning its value cannot be changed once initialized.

//Null Safety: A final variable must be initialized before the constructor completes, reducing null pointer errors.

//Efficiency:Using final can lead to performance optimization, as the compiler can make certain assumptions about final elements.

//Immutable Objects: Helps in creating immutable objects in combination with private fields and no setter methods
